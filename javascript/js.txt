69. Which was one of the first security subsets proposed?
a) FBJS
b) Caja
c) dojox.secure
d) ADSafe
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: ADsafe was one of the first security subsets proposed) It was created by Douglas Crockford (who also defined The Good Parts subset). ADsafe relies on static verification only, and it uses JSLint as its verifier. It forbids access to most global variables and defines an ADSAFE variable that provides access to a secure API, including special-purpose DOM methods. ADsafe is not in wide use, but it was an influential proof-of-concept that influenced other secure subsets.

70. Which is the subset that transforms web content into secure modules that can be safely hosted on a web page?
a) Microsoft Web Sandbox
b) ADsafe
c) Caja
d) dojox.secure
View Answer

Answer: d
Explanation: Caja is Google’s open-source secure subset. Caja (Spanish for “box”) defines two language subsets. Cajita (“little box”) is a narrow subset like that used by ADsafe and dojox.secure. Valija (“suitcase” or “baggage”) is a much broader language that is close to regular ECMAScript 5 strict mode (with the removal of eval()). Caja itself is the name of the compiler that transforms (or “cajoles”) web content (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code) into secure modules that can be safely hosted on a web page without being able to affect the page as a whole or other modules on the page.

a) Returns the same kind of array whether or not the regular expression has the global g flag
b) Returns different arrays in the different turns of iterations
c) Return a sub part of the array
d) Returns a null value
View Answer

Answer: a
Explanation: exec() returns the same kind of array whether or not the regular expression has the global g flag. Recall that match() returns an array of matches when passed a global regular expression. exec(), by contrast, always returns a single match and provides complete information about that match. When exec() is called on a regular expression that has the g flag, it sets the lastIndex property of the regular expression object to the character position immediately following the matched substring. When exec() is invoked a second time for the same regular expression, it begins its search at the character position indicated by the lastIndex property. If exec() does not find a match, it resets lastIndex to 0.

165.What is the purpose of array slice method?
The slice() method returns the selected elements in an array as a new array object. It selects the elements starting at the given start argument, and ends at the given optional end argument without including the last element. If you omit the second argument then it selects till the end. Some of the examples of this method are,

let arrayIntegers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegers.slice(0,2); // returns [1,2]
let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegers.slice(2,3); // returns [3]
let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegers.slice(4); //returns [5]

166.What is the purpose of array splice method?
The splice() method is used either adds/removes items to/from an array, and then returns the removed item. The first argument specifies the array position for insertion or deletion whereas the option second argument indicates the number of elements to be deleted. Each additional argument is added to the array. Some of the examples of this method are,

let arrayIntegersOriginal1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arrayIntegersOriginal2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let arrayIntegersOriginal3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegersOriginal1.splice(0,2); // returns [1, 2]; original array: [3, 4, 5]
let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegersOriginal2.splice(3); // returns [4, 5]; original array: [1, 2, 3]
let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegersOriginal3.splice(3, 1, "a", "b", "c"); //returns [4]; 

167.What is the difference between slice and splice?

Slice	                                        Splice

Doesn't modify the original array(immutable).	Modifies the original array(mutable).
Returns the subset of original array.	        Returns the deleted elements as array.
Used to pick the elements from array.	        Used to insert or delete elements to/from array.

168.What are lambda or arrow functions?
An arrow function is a shorter syntax for a function expression and does not have its own this, arguments, super, or new.target. 
These function are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.

169.What is the difference between let and var?
You can list out the differences in a tabular format

var                                                             let
	
It is been available from the beginning of JavaScript.  	Introduced as part of ES6.
It has function scope.                                          It has block scope.
Variables will be hoisted.	                                Hoisted but not initialized.

Let's take an example to see the difference,

function userDetails(username) {
   if(username) {
     console.log(salary); // undefined(due to hoisting)
     console.log(age); // error: age is not defined
     let age = 30;
     var salary = 10000;
   }
   console.log(salary); //10000 (accessible to due function scope)
   console.log(age); //error: age is not defined(due to block scope)
}

169.What is the reason to choose the name let as keyword?
Let is a mathematical statement that was adopted by early programming languages like Scheme and Basic. It has been borrowed from dozens of other languages 
that use let already as a traditional keyword as close to var as possible.

170.What is IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)?
IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. The signature of it would be as below,

(function ()
    {
      // logic here
    }
 )
();
The primary reason to use an IIFE is to obtain data privacy because any variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world. i.e, If you try to access variables with IIFE then it throws an error as below,

(function ()
        {
          var message = "IIFE";
          console.log(message);
        }
 )
();
console.log(message); //Error: message is not defined

172.What are closures?
A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. i.e, It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing function’s variables. The closure has three scope chains

Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets
Outer function’s variables
Global variables Let's take an example of closure concept,
function Welcome(name){
  var greetingInfo = function(message){
   console.log(message+' '+name);
  }
return greetingInfo;
}
var myFunction = Welcome('John');
myFunction('Welcome '); //Output: Welcome John
myFunction('Hello Mr.'); //output: Hello Mr.John
As per the above code, the inner function(greetingInfo) has access to the variables in the outer function scope(Welcome) even after outer function has 
returned.

173.What is scope in javascript?
Scope is the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of your code during runtime. In other words, scope determines the 
visibility of variables and other resources in areas of your code.

175.What is web storage?
Web storage is an API that provides a mechanism by which browsers can store key/value pairs locally within the user's browser, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies. The web storage provides two mechanisms for storing data on the client.

Local storage: It stores data for current origin with no expiration date.
Session storage: It stores data for one session and the data is lost when the browser tab is closed.

176.What are the restrictions of web workers on DOM?

186.How do you assign default values to variables?
You can use the logical or operator || in an assignment expression to provide a default value. The syntax looks like as below,

var a = b || c;
As per the above expression, variable 'a 'will get the value of 'c' only if 'b' is falsy (if is null, false, undefined, 0, empty string, or NaN), 
otherwise 'a' will get the value of 'b'.

z=
x+y;
The above code is perfectly fine, though not advisable as it hampers debugging.

If you use innerHTML in JavaScript the disadvantage is

Content is replaced everywhere
We cannot use like "appending to innerHTML"
Even if you use +=like "innerHTML = innerHTML + 'html'" still the old content is replaced by html
The entire innerHTML content is re-parsed and build into elements, therefore its much slower
The innerHTML does not provide validation and therefore we can potentially insert valid and broken HTML in the document and break it

There are three types of errors:

Load time errors: Errors which come up when loading a web page like improper syntax errors are known as Load time errors and it generates the errors dynamically.
Run time errors: Errors that come due to misuse of the command inside the HTML language.
Logical Errors: These are the errors that occur due to the bad logic performed on a function which is having different operation.

290.How will you explain closures in JavaScript? When are they used?

Closure is a locally declared variable related to a function which stays in memory when the function has returned.

For example:

function greet(message) {

    console.log(message);

}

function greeter(name, age) {

    return name + " says howdy!! He is " + age + " years old";

}

// Generate the message

var message = greeter("James", 23);

// Pass it explicitly to greet

greet(message);

This function can be better represented by using closures

function greeter(name, age) {

    var message = name + " says howdy!! He is " + age + " years old";

    return function greet() {

        console.log(message);

    };

}

// Generate the closure

var JamesGreeter = greeter("James", 23);

// Use the closure

JamesGreeter();

In each repetition, one property from the object is associated to the variable name, 
and the loop is continued till all the properties of the object are depleted.

292.Describe the properties of an anonymous function in JavaScript?

A function that is declared without any named identifier is known as an anonymous function. In general, an anonymous function is inaccessible after its declaration.

DOM is required for developing web pages, which includes objects like paragraph, links, etc. These objects can be operated to include actions like add or delete. DOM is also required to add extra 
capabilities to a web page. On top of that, the use of API gives an advantage over other existing models.

298.Explain the unshift() method ?

This method is functional at the starting of the array, unlike the push(). It adds the desired number of elements to the top of an array. For example -

var name = [ "john" ];

innerHTML content is refreshed every time and thus is slower. There is no scope for validation in innerHTML and, 
therefore, it is easier to insert rouge code in the document and, thus, make the web page unstable.

300.How are JavaScript and ECMA Script related?

ECMA Script are like rules and guideline while Javascript is a scripting language used for web development.

301. What are the features of JavaScript?
Features - JavaScript Interview Questions

Following are the features of JavaScript:

It is a lightweight, interpreted programming language.
It is designed for creating network-centric applications.
It is complementary to and integrated with Java.
It is an open and cross-platform scripting language.

302.Can you assign an anonymous function to a variable and pass it as an argument to another function?
Yes! An anonymous function can be assigned to a variable. It can also be passed as an argument to another function.

303.What are the scopes of a variable in JavaScript?
The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript variable will have only two scopes.
• Global Variables − A global variable has global scope which means it is visible everywhere in your JavaScript code.
• Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.

304. List out the different ways an HTML element can be accessed in a JavaScript code.
Here are the list of ways an HTML element can be accessed in a Javascript code:
(i) getElementById(‘idname’): Gets an element by its ID name
(ii) getElementsByClass(‘classname’): Gets all the elements that have the given classname.
(iii) getElementsByTagName(‘tagname’): Gets all the elements that have the given tag name.
(iv) querySelector(): This function takes css style selector and returns the first selected element.

305.What are the ways to define a variable in JavaScript?
The three possible ways of defining a variable in JavaScript are:

Var – The JavaScript variables statement is used to declare a variable and, optionally, we can initialize the value of that variable. Example: var a =10; Variable declarations are processed before the execution of the code.
Const – The idea of const functions is not allow them to modify the object on which they are called. When a function is declared as const, it can be called on any type of object.
Let – It is a signal that the variable may be reassigned, such as a counter in a loop, or a value swap in an algorithm. It also signals that the variable will be used only in the block it’s defined in.

306.What is a Typed language?
Typed Language is in which the values are associated with values and not with variables. It is of two types:

Dynamically: in this, the variable can hold multiple types; like in JS a variable can take number, chars.
Statically: in this, the variable can hold only one type, like in Java a variable declared of string can take only set of characters and nothing else.

307. What is the difference between null & undefined?
Undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. On the other hand, null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value. Also, undefined and null are two distinct types: undefined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object.

308.What is the difference between undeclared & undefined?
Undeclared variables are those that do not exist in a program and are not declared. If the program tries to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered. Undefined variables are those that are declared in the program but have not been given any value. If the program tries to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned.

309.Name some of the JavaScript Frameworks
JavaScript Frameworks - JavaScript interview questionsA JavaScript framework is an application framework written in JavaScript. It differs from a JavaScript library in its control flow. There are many JavaScript Frameworks available but some of the most commonly used frameworks are:

Angular
React
Vue

<script>
const first_num;
first_num =1000;
document.getElementById("display").innerHTML = "First Number:"+ first_num;
</script>
</body>
</html>
Answer: The ‘const’ variable ’first_num’ is not initialized with a value, so the code will produce a Syntax Error.

The output of the code snippet here is:

Error: Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in the const declaration

314. What is the use of ‘debugger’ keyword in JavaScript code?

Answer: Using the ‘debugger’ keyword in the code is like using breakpoints in the debugger.

To test the code, the debugger must be enabled for the browser. If debugging is disabled for the browser, the code will not work. During debugging the code below should stop executing, before it goes to the next line.

315.What is JavaScript ‘Strict Mode’?

Answer: ‘Strict mode’ is a restricted variant of JavaScript.

Usually, JavaScript is ‘not very strict’ in throwing errors.

But in ‘Strict mode’ it will throw all types of errors, even the silent errors. Thus, the process of debugging becomes easier. And the chances for making mistake for the developer is reduced.

316. What are the characteristics of JavaScript ‘Strict Mode’?

Answer: Given below are the characteristics of JavaScript ‘Strict Mode’:

‘Strict Mode’ will stop developers from creating global variables.
Developers are restricted from using duplicate parameters.
Strict mode will restrict you from using JavaScript keyword as a variable name or function name.
Strict mode is declared with ‘use strict’ keyword at the beginning of the script.
All browser support strict mode.

317.What is the syntax of ‘Self Invoking Function’? Give an example?

Answer:

The syntax for the Self-Invoking function:

(function () {
return () } () ;
Here the last ‘()’ parenthesis in the syntax states that it is a function expression.

318. In the following Code snippet, can you please predict the output or If you get an error; please explain the error?

Answer: 

<!DOCTYPE html>

The output of the code snippet here is:

                Here the variable first_num: 100 is taken to the top
               Since the second variable is initialized the value is not taken to the top and its value is undefined

var result= function(){
document.getElementById("display").innerHTML = first_num;
var first_num =1000;
}
result();
</script>
</body>
</html>
Answer: Here in the code given above, the value of the ‘first_num’ variable will not be 1000.

In JavaScript, there is no hoisting for variable initialization. The function ‘result ()’ will choose the local variable ‘first_num’, as it is declared inside the function. Since the variable is declared after it is used, the value of ‘first_num’ is undefined.
The output of the code snippet here is:

Undefined

Answer: Please refer Ques No: 21 before reading further

The output of the code snippet is:

            First Number:501

We will also get an Error while running the code, as we are trying to change the value of a ‘const’ variable.

Error: Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

321.What are ‘settimeout()’?

Answer: (It better to explain this answer with an example)

Consider the code snippet

Console.log (‘First Line’);
Console.log (‘Second Line’);
Console.log (‘Third Line’);
The output of the code snippet here is:

First Line
Second Line
Third Line

Now you introduce settimeout() method and wrap the same set of code in it.
Settimeout(function() {
Console.log (‘First Line’);
},0);
Console.log (‘Second Line’);
Console.log (‘Third Line’);
The output of the code snippet here is:

Second Line
Third Line
First Line

With the introduction of settimeout(), the processes become asynchronous. The first statements to be placed in the stack is Console.log (‘Second Line’), and Console.log (‘Third Line’), and they will get executed first. You need to wait until everything in the stack is completed first.

Even though ‘0’ is the timeout period, it doesn’t mean that it will be executed right away.
